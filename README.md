# Image Grayscaling using Python

This project converts a color image into a grayscale image using Python.
It is a self-learning mini project to understand basic image processing concepts.

## Features
- Converts RGB images to grayscale
- Simple and beginner-friendly code
- Supports JPG and PNG images

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2) / NumPy

## How Grayscaling Works
Grayscale conversion is done using the luminosity method:

Gray = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
